## How We Achieve Cross-chain Capability
![image](https://github.com/ahmadstiff/caer/blob/main/caer-fe/public/Caer-Flow1.jpg)
To enable seamless cross-chain lending and borrowing in CaÃ©r, we utilize a structured process that ensures security and efficiency. Our system leverages the Application-Specific Sequencer (ASS), Espresso confirmations, and solvers to facilitate interactions across different chains. ASS plays a crucial role in verifying data across chains, ensuring valid transactions, and maintaining system integrity. Below is an overview of our cross-chain lending mechanism:

### 1. User Collateral Deposit
- The user deposits **1 WETH** as collateral on **Chain A**.

### 2. User Loan Request
- The user initiates a request to borrow **100 USDC** on **Chain B**.

### 3. ASS Verification & Sequencer Check
- ASS verifies the deposit on **Chain A** to ensure the user has sufficient collateral.
- The ASS cross-checks the deposit status before approving the loan request.

### 4. Espresso Confirmation & Sequencer Signature Generation
- The sequencer leverages **Espresso confirmations** to ensure transaction finality within **sub-15 seconds**.
- Once confirmed, ASS generates a **signature**, verifying that the deposit exists and the loan request is valid.

### 5. Transaction Processing
- The generated **ASS signature** is embedded into the transaction, enabling secure execution on **Chain B**.

### 6. Solver Loan Execution
- The solver, upon receiving the verified **ASS signature**, releases **100 USDC** to the user's address on **Chain B**.

## Benefits
By integrating **ASS**, **CaÃ©r** ensures:
- **Trustless execution**
- **Fast transaction finality**
- **Enhanced cross-chain security**

This makes lending and borrowing **seamless and reliable** across multiple chains.

## Note
- For the purposes of this **hackathon**, we are using **mock tokens** to simulate transactions and interactions within the platform.
- The platform is currently operating on a **testnet environment**.
